## SATURDAY, JULY 25TH, 2015 1PM – 7PM
at [REVERSE](http://reversespace.org/)

This workshop is for artists, developers, educators or anyone interested in experimenting with the Raspberry Pi. We’ll start from the basics and move quickly towards setting up the Raspberry Pi to run your own video projects. By the end of the workshop we’ll have built up an installation-ready Pi for your video based and interactive pieces.

We will be discussing setup for gallery installations, installing software, adding your own video content, setting up playlists and hooking up to external displays. Bring your own video content and we can help optimize for the Pi.
